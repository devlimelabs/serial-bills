## Development Process

### Research Phase
The research phase involved gathering information from multiple authoritative sources on currency collecting, including:
- MyCurrencyCollection.com
- CoinValueChecker.com
- Auction records and collector forums
- Statistical analysis of pattern probabilities

Research focused on identifying pattern types, determining value ranges based on market data, and calculating statistical rarity. All findings were documented with source attribution.

### Content Creation
Content was structured into a comprehensive guide covering:
- Detailed descriptions of 19 distinct pattern types
- Value rankings organized into 6 tiers
- Statistical rarity calculations
- Value factors affecting collectibility
- Identification methods and examples

The content was written to be both educational for beginners and valuable for experienced collectors, with an emphasis on accuracy and detail.

### Web Design & Development
The web development process followed modern best practices:

1. **Design Phase**
   - Created wireframes for desktop and mobile layouts
   - Designed card-based pattern display system
   - Planned interactive elements and user flows
   - Established visual language with icon-heavy approach

2. **Frontend Development**
   - Built with semantic HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript
   - Implemented responsive design for all device sizes
   - Created custom SVG icons for each pattern type
   - Developed interactive search and filtering system

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Implemented comparative charts for value analysis
   - Created rarity visualization components
   - Built interactive pattern relationship diagrams
   - Developed serial number checker tool with value estimation

4. **Testing & Optimization**
   - Tested functionality across devices and browsers
   - Optimized performance for smooth interactions
   - Verified data accuracy and visualization correctness
   - Ensured accessibility compliance
