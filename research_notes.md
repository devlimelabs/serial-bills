This source provided additional details on fancy serial numbers, their definitions, and value ranges:

* **Low Serial Numbers:**
  * 00000001 to 00000009: $600 - $3500 (value decreases as number approaches 9)
  * 00000010 to 00000099: Up to $300-500 (value decreases as number approaches 99)

* **High Serial Numbers:**
  * With five nines at beginning: $50 - $80
  * With six or seven nines: $100 - $400

* **Ladder Serial Numbers:**
  * Ascending (e.g., 12345678) or descending (e.g., 98765432)
  * Descending ladders are rarer and more valuable
  * Value range: $600 - $2,100 depending on uniqueness and condition

* **Binary Serial Numbers:**
  * Regular binary (two digits): $20 - $75
  * True binary (only 0s and 1s): $40 - $150

* **Radar Serial Numbers:**
  * Same forward and backward (e.g., 12533521)
  * Value: $15 - $20 over face value
  * Binary radar and repeater radar subtypes exist

* **Repeater Serial Numbers:**
  * First four and last four digits are the same (e.g., 83428342)
  * Value: $25 - $50
  * Super repeater variation: first two digits repeated four times (e.g., 98989898)

* **Solid Serial Numbers:**
  * All eight digits are the same (e.g., 44444444)
  * Extremely valuable, especially 9s which are rare in modern printing
  * Have sold for as much as $20,000

* **Million Serial Numbers:**
  * Single digit followed by seven zeros (e.g., 90000000)
  * Value: $700 - $1,800

**Additional factors affecting value:**
* Condition (uncirculated notes worth significantly more)
* Denomination (higher denominations sometimes less collectible)
* Age of note (older series can be more valuable)
* Rarity of the specific pattern

Both sources emphasize that values are approximate and can vary significantly based on condition, with uncirculated notes commanding the highest prices.
